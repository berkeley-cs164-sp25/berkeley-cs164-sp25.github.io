        Today we&rsquo;re going to talk about about the role of optimization in
        compilers. We&rsquo;ll also see how to extend our class compiler with a
        particular optimization, constant folding.
      </p>

            Let&rsquo;s start by talking a bit about optimization in general,
            and then we&rsquo;ll dive in on implementation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="outline-container-org0867ad5" class="outline-3">
          <h3 id="org0867ad5">Why do we call it this?</h3>
          <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0867ad5">
            <p>
              First let&rsquo;s talk about this name, optimization. I&rsquo;ll
              indulge in a brief rant about this name. It&rsquo;s rather
              misleading. When we do &ldquo;optimization&rdquo; in the compiler,
              we&rsquo;re trying to make programs better. What we&rsquo;re not
              doing (or even defining) is making them optimal. So it
              doesn&rsquo;t make a ton of sense to say optimizing.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now, there are variants that do actually optimize, for some
              definition of optimal. They had to invent a new term for that,
              <i>superoptimization</i>. In superoptimization, we define a space
              of possible programs and search for the best program in that
              space, for some definition of best. For instance, we might decide
              that we&rsquo;re searching all sequences of instructions up to
              length 5 that perform the same task as the 10 instructions
              we&rsquo;re optimizing. And then if we have a cost metric, we can
              pick the sequence of 5 instructions that&rsquo;s best according to
              that cost metric.
            </p>

            <p>
              All of which to say, optimization isn&rsquo;t a particularly
              sensible name. But it&rsquo;s the standard name that we use for
              these techniques in the field, so we&rsquo;ll go ahead and call it
              optimization anyway. We&rsquo;ll even try not to be too upset
              about it.
            </p>

              Well, we&rsquo;re trying to make them better. Here&rsquo;s our
              list of criteria, for making a successful optimizer:
            </p>
            <ol class="org-ol">
              <li>Preserve the meaning of the program.</li>
              <li>Make the program “better”</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Q: What do you think we mean by better?</p>

            <p>Here are a few things we might mean:</p>
            <ul class="org-ul">
              <li>
                runs faster
                <ul class="org-ul">
                  <li>runs in less time on my computer</li>
                  <li>better worst-case asymptotic execution time</li>
                  <li>(note: these two items above are really different)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                lower memory consumption
                <ul class="org-ul">
                  <li>measured</li>
                  <li>or worst-case asymptotic</li>
                  <li>(same pattern as above)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                lower energy consumption
                <ul class="org-ul">
                  <li>
                    (note: the CPU is the big energy consumer, so people often
                    use run time as proxy)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>small program size</li>
              <li>
                no redundant work
                <ul class="org-ul">
                  <li>(relates to the faster idea)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                more effective use of the hardware
                <ul class="org-ul">
                  <li>(e.g., better cache utilization)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Here are some other things that we probably think make programs
              better, but which optimizers aren&rsquo;t well placed to tackle:
            </p>
            <ul class="org-ul">
              <li>
                readability
                <ul class="org-ul">
                  <li>
                    (by the time we&rsquo;re doing optimization, we&rsquo;re
                    about to produce assembly, and humans probably aren&rsquo;t
                    looking at it much anymore!)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                correctness
                <ul class="org-ul">
                  <li>
                    (we already decided the optimizer had to preserve the
                    meaning of the program; it would be frustrating if our
                    compiler was changing our programs&rsquo; meanings!)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              In lecture, we take some time to talk about each of these and how
              often we&rsquo;re ending up doing them. For instance, most of the
              time&#x2014;with some exceptions&#x2014;we&rsquo;re not changing
              the worst-case asymptotic execution time of input programs in the
              optimizer. If you try plotting the runtime of a given program with
              different input sizes for a well-optimized compiler vs. an
              unoptimized compiler&#x2014;or even C++ vs.
              Python&#x2014;you&rsquo;ll see a difference in performance, but it
              will probably be a constant factor. Most compilers aren&rsquo;t
              doing algorithmic changes that alter how the program works.
              It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s not possible! Some transformations
              do actually change the big O analysis. But it&rsquo;s safe to
              assume that the common performance-focused goal, for most
              optimizers at the moment, is to improve performance by a constant
              factor, in order to improve execution time on some set of
              computers that we care about.
            </p>

            <p>
              Small program size also deserves a bit of a discussion. If we see
              a 10-line program and a million-line program that do the same
              thing, we often prefer the short one. In part, we use it as a
              proxy for performance, but we also just like small programs for
              their own sake. They&rsquo;re easier to keep around, easier to
              move. We do care about this, at least a little, in our compiler.
              If it&rsquo;s a choice between a 10-line and a million-line
              program, and the run time of the million-line program is 10%
              faster, we&rsquo;ll probably still want to go with producing the
              10-line program. But if it&rsquo;s a choice between a 10-line
              program and a 20-line program, and the 20-line program executes
              10% faster, we may be willing to take the longer program. We can
              often do some amount of trading off program size for speed.
            </p>

            <p>
              We&rsquo;ll mostly focus on making programs faster rather than on
              the other goals you may have brainstormed, but we can use some of
              the same techniques for the other goals.

            <p>
              Let&rsquo;s take a moment to zoom out and think about how our
              whole compiler is structured.
            </p>

            <figure id="orgaee88af">
              <img
                src="./imgs/compiler-diagram.png"
                alt="compiler-diagram.png"
              />
            </figure>

            <p>
              We have the input program string. The tokenizer (or lexer)
              tokenizes it into tokens. The parser parses the tokens into an
              AST. The code generator generates assembly from the AST. And the
              linker (and assembler) produce machine code from the assembly.
              This process takes us all the way from source code to machine
              code. It doesn&rsquo;t look like we need an optimizer along the
              way. And we don&rsquo;t! But we can add some if we want.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are a couple places where we can add them. It&rsquo;s very
              common to add optimizers once we have ASTs, and we can use them to
              transform from one AST to an equivalent AST that will produce more
              efficient assembly. This is the style of optimizer we&rsquo;ll see
              today.
            </p>

            <p>
              We can also do <i>peephole optimization</i>, which works not on
              ASTs but on assembly. See lecture capture for a quick example of
              how peephole optimization works.
            </p>
          </div>

        <div id="outline-container-orgf3d19c3" class="outline-3">
          <h3 id="orgf3d19c3">What about ordering?</h3>
          <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf3d19c3">
            <p>
              You may notice from the diagram above that we can have multiple
              optimizations, all of which transform from AST to AST. This may
              make you wonder&#x2014;how do we know how to order them? This is
              an especially big question for industrial compilers which have a
              lot of these optimization passes, often hundreds and hundreds of
              them. And the order really matters! It could be that optimization
              A will find only 3 places to improve if we run it alone, but 300
              if we run it after optimization B. So how do we know how to order
              our optimization passes? Well the short answer is, we don&rsquo;t.
            </p>

            <p>
              Deciding how to order optimizations in a compiler is a classic
              problem called the <i>phase-ordering</i> problem. And basically
              it&rsquo;s still a big open question how we should do this. In
              fact, it&rsquo;s even more complicated than just picking one slot
              for each of x optimizations. Sometimes we run optimization A and
              find 100 places where we can improve things, then run optimization
              B which changes the AST, and then if we run optimization A again
              we&rsquo;ll find another 100 places where we can improve things!
              So since we don&rsquo;t have a clean, theoretical framework for
              how to order these optimizations, what do production compilers do?
              Essentially, run these optimizations over and over again. Keep
              circling back around, hoping to find more places to improve
              everything.

        <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org10e213c">
          <p>Enough of this chit chat! Let&rsquo;s implement some stuff.</p>

          <p>
            Here&rsquo;s our problem: programmers are doing good programming
            practices and making their programs readable by doing extra
            computation. For instance, say we know a time limit in our program
            should be 5 minutes, but our program needs it in milliseconds. Maybe
            we write
            <code
              >(let ((time-limit (* 5 (* seconds-per-minute
              milliseconds-per-second)))) in ...)</code
            >
            even though we know <code>time-limit</code> will always turn out to
            be 300000. We want to let the programmer do that, but we still want
            to give them the blazing fast program execution experience of having
            written <code>(let ((time-limit 300000)) in ...)</code>. And we can
            give that to them, via the power of <i>constant folding</i>.
            Constant folding is when we recognize that a given expression is a
            constant, we go ahead and evaluate the expression to find the
            constant, then replace the expression with the constant&#x2014;all
            at compile time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here&rsquo;s a simple program we might want to speed up:
            <code>(add1 5)</code>
          </p>

          <p>
            What program would we like to produce instead? Probably just
            <code>6</code>.
          </p>

          <p>
            So let&rsquo;s write the transformation that would handle exactly
            this case. We&rsquo;ll write it in a separate
            <code>constant_folding.ml</code> file, and then we&rsquo;ll call it
            from the compiler before we start emitting assembly.

          <p>
            Looks good! With this, we can successfully tackle
            <code>(add1 5)</code>.
          </p>

          <p>
            This means we&rsquo;ve successfully built an optimization! We
            fulfilled criteria (1) preserves meaning and (2) improves some
            programs.
          </p>

          <p>
            But what about this program? <code>(add1 (add1 5))</code> This time
            we&rsquo;ll try to match with the <code>Prim1</code> case, but since
            <code>(add1 5)</code> is an expr, not a Num, we&rsquo;ll give up and
            send back our original program, <code>(add1 (add1 5))</code>.
          </p>

          <p>Fortunately we can do better:</p>
          <div class="org-src-container">
            <label class="org-src-name"
              ><span class="listing-number">Listing 2: </span
              ><code>constant_folding.ml</code></label
            >
            <pre class="src src-ocaml">
let rec fold : expr -&gt; expr = function
  | Prim1 (Add1, e) -&gt; (
      let e = fold e in
      match e with Num n -&gt; Num (n + 1) | _ -&gt; Prim1 (Add1, e) )
  | e -&gt;
      e
</pre
            >
          </div>

          <p>
            Now we make a recursive call to <code>fold</code> once we&rsquo;ve
            matched the outer <code>Add1</code>, so if we find we can reduce the
            argument to a <code>Num</code>, we&rsquo;ll be able to reduce the
            outer <code>Add1</code> as well. That&rsquo;s exactly what happens
            with <code>(add1 (add1 5))</code>. We match the outer
            <code>Add1</code>, make a recursive call on the inner
            <code>Add1</code>, reduce that to <code>Num 6</code>, and then we
            can reduce the outer <code>Add1</code> to <code>Num 7</code>.
            Lovely.
          </p>

          <p>
            But of course we&rsquo;re not done. What about
            <code>(sub1 (add1 5))</code>? And what about
            <code>(let ((x (add1 (add1 5)))) x)</code>?
          </p>

          <p>
            Here&rsquo;s the implementation of constant folding once we&rsquo;ve
            gone ahead and traversed more of the AST to catch cases like
            <code>(let ((x (add1 (add1 5)))) x)</code>. We&rsquo;ve also added
            support for finding constants that are constructed with
            <code>Sub1</code> and <code>Plus</code>. We didn&rsquo;t bother to
            flesh out quite everything. (E.g. there&rsquo;s no case for
            <code>Sub</code>.) But this should give you enough context that you
            could complete this compiler pass on your own.

            Our constant folding implementation above just tackles numbers, but

              Optimization is a huge, huge area. If you take a grad compilers
              course, solid chance you&rsquo;ll spend almost the entire course
              on optimization, and you still won&rsquo;t have learned all there
              is to know. Optimization is still an extremely active area of
              research, and there&rsquo;s more happening in this area all the
              time.
            </p>

            <p>
              What we&rsquo;ll be learning in this class are some of the general
              patterns, which will serve as a solid foundation if you want to
              learn more optimization techniques going forward. Although we
              won&rsquo;t be implementing any additional optimizations in our
              in-class compiler, we <i>will</i> be seeing more in lecture, so
              swing by class. And we&rsquo;ll also be implementing some
              optimizations in the final homework of the semester.
