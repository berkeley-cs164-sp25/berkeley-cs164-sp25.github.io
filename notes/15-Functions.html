        Today we&rsquo;re adding functions to our language! A very exciting day
        for us!
      </p>

      <p>Here are some programs we&rsquo;ll be able to support after today:</p>

      <div class="org-src-container">
        <pre class="src src-lisp">
(define (id x) x)
(print (id 4))
</pre
        >

(define (odd n) (if (zero? n) false (even (sub1 n))))
(print (even (read-num)))

      </div>

      <p>
        You may notice some patterns that will constrain our implementation and
        others that will make it easier. Here are a few interesting patterns:
      </p>
      <ul class="org-ul">
        <li>We can have multiple expressions now.</li>
        <li>Functions can be recursive (and mutually recursive).</li>
        <li>
          Function definitions are always at the top level&#x2014;we don&rsquo;t
          have function definitions nested inside other function definitions or
          inside let expressions.
        </li>
        <li>Function definitions appear before the body of the program.</li>
        <li>We&rsquo;re not using functions as values.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You might also notice there&rsquo;s a regular structure to each of those
        function definitions. They each seem to have a name, which is a string;
        a list of arguments, which is a list of strings; and a body, which is
        any s-expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        To support us in implementing functions in both the interpreter and the
        compiler, we&rsquo;re going to introduce a new type, <code>defn</code>.
        We&rsquo;ll use this type to represent function definitions, and it will
        include those same pieces of information we noticed in each of our
        function definitions: name, arguments, and body.
      </p>

      <div class="org-src-container">
        <label class="org-src-name"
          ><span class="listing-number">Listing 1: </span
          ><code>util.ml</code></label
        >
        <pre class="src src-ocaml">
type defn = {name: string; args: string list; body: s_exp}
</pre
        >
      </div>

      <p>
        We&rsquo;ll also have a helper function, <code>defns_and_body</code>,
        which will just take care of retrieving definitions and the program body
        out of the list of s-expressions we get from parsing our programs.
      </p>

      <div id="outline-container-org28a34d4" class="outline-2">
        <h2 id="org28a34d4">Functions in the Interpreter:</h2>
        <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org28a34d4">
          <p>
            To kick things off, we&rsquo;ll have to start by changing our
            <code>interp</code> function. Previously it called
            <code>parse</code> to parse a single s-expression in each input
            program. Now we&rsquo;ll use <code>parse_many</code> to retrieve a
            list of s-expressions instead. Once we&rsquo;ve used our
            <code>defns_and_body</code> helper to grab out the definitions and
            body, we&rsquo;re ready to modify our call to
            <code>interp_exp</code>. We&rsquo;ll probably want
            <code>body</code> to be the thing we&rsquo;re interpreting, but how
            should we communicate the definitions? We&rsquo;ll go ahead and add
            those as an additional argument to <code>interp_exp</code>.
          </p>

          <div class="org-src-container">
            <label class="org-src-name"
              ><span class="listing-number">Listing 2: </span
              ><code>interp.ml</code></label
            >
            <pre class="src src-ocaml">
let rec interp_exp (defns : defn list) (env : value symtab) (exp : s_exp) :
    value =
  (* ... *)

let interp (program : string) : unit =
  let defns, body = parse_many program |&gt; get_defns_and_body in
  interp_exp defns Symtab.empty body |&gt; ignore
</pre
            >
          </div>

          <p>
            Now that we&rsquo;ve changed the type signature of
            <code>interp_exp</code>, we&rsquo;ll have to do a bit of bookkeeping
            to make sure all our old calls to <code>interp_exp</code> pass those
            <code>defns</code> around too. Since the program always has the same
            set of definitions available (remember, all definitions appear at
            the top level for now), we won&rsquo;t need to update them anywhere.
            We&rsquo;ll just pass them around.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ok, now that we have our function <i>definitions</i> available, what
            do we do once we spot a function <i>call</i>? We have an interesting
            decision to make about where we want to put our function call case
            relative to other cases in <code>compile_exp</code>&rsquo;s
            top-level match. Say the programmer defines a function named
            <code>+</code>, and say we put our function call case before our
            addition case. That means the programmer will be able to change what
            <code>+</code> does in our language. We&rsquo;ll go ahead and put
            the function call case right at the top of our match.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here we also want to think about how to make the arguments available
            when we&rsquo;re evaluating the function. Fortunately we already
            know one way to make values available by names! We&rsquo;ve been
            using our environment <code>symtab</code> to keep track of let-bound
            items for a while now. We&rsquo;ll use that same mechanism to make
            function arguments available while we&rsquo;re evaluating the body
            of a function.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll add to our
            <code>interp_exp</code> function:
          </p>

          <div class="org-src-container">
            <label class="org-src-name"
              ><span class="listing-number">Listing 3: </span
              ><code>interp.ml</code></label
            >
            <pre class="src src-ocaml">
let rec interp_exp (defns : defn list) (env : value symtab) (exp : s_exp) :
    value =
  (* ... *)
  | Lst (Sym f :: args) when is_defn defns f -&gt;
      let defn = get_defn defns f in
      if List.length args = List.length defn.args then
	let vals = List.map (interp_exp defns env) args in
	let fenv = (List.combine defn.args vals) |&gt; Symtab.of_list in
	interp_exp defns fenv defn.body
      else raise (BadExpression exp)
</pre
            >
          </div>

          <p>
            Notice what we do to make sure this is really a valid function call.
            We use <code>when is_defn defns</code> to make sure that the symbol
            <code>f</code> is actually the name of one of the functions the
            programmer defined. Then we make sure that the number of arguments
            that appear in the function call matches the number of arguments the
            function definition accepts. If both of those conditions are met,
            we&rsquo;re good to go.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also want to notice what&rsquo;s going on with the environments
            we&rsquo;re passing into our <code>interp_exp</code> calls. When
            we&rsquo;re evaluating the expressions in the argument list, we use
            <code>env</code>, the environment we received. When we&rsquo;re
            evaluating the body of the function, we discard
            <i>everything</i> from <code>env</code>. Instead we make a new
            environment that contains only the argument names, mapped to outputs
            from evaluating the argument expressions.
          </p>

          <p>
            The choice we made about the environment determines how scoping
            works in our language. If we&rsquo;d decided to make a new symtab
            that included <i>both</i> the original <code>env</code> names and
            the function arguments, we&rsquo;d have produced
            <i>dynamic scope</i>. This was once a fairly popular approach to
            scoping, but it turns out to be very difficult for programmers to
            reason about. These days, it&rsquo;s rare to see languages
            implementing dynamic scope. Instead we chose to provide an
            environment that included only the function&rsquo;s arguments. This
            means our language has <i>lexical scope</i>. With lexical scope, we
            can refer to names only within certain textual regions of the
            program. For example, say we define a function <code>f</code>:
            <code>(define (f x y) (+ (g x) (g y)))</code>. With lexical scope,
            we can refer to <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> in the body of
            <code>f</code>, but we can&rsquo;t refer to them once we&rsquo;re in
            the body of <code>g</code>, even though <code>g</code> is called by
            <code>f</code>.
          </p>

        <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgecc46b9">
          <p>
            Now that we&rsquo;ve seen how it works in the interpreter,
            let&rsquo;s try to do the same thing with the compiler.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unfortunately, one part of our interpreter approach really
            won&rsquo;t work here. In the interpreter, whenever we encountered a
            function call, we grabbed the body of the function and evaluated it.
            Say we tried to do the same thing here. Every time we encounter a
            function call, we could try to emit the assembly directives for
            executing the function body. What would happen if we tried to do
            this for the third and fourth example programs above?
          </p>

          <p>
            Since we can&rsquo;t take that naive approach, we&rsquo;ll have to
            find a way to put the function bodies into the assembly code once,
            then jump to them whenever we need to execute the function.
            Forunately we&rsquo;ve already had some good practice with calling
            functions&#x2014;we&rsquo;ve already been calling the C functions we
            defined in our runtime. We&rsquo;ll be able to do a similar process
            for functions defined in our own input programs.
          </p>

          <p>
            We&rsquo;ll start with doing some of the same bookkeeping we did in
            the interpreter&#x2014;calling <code>parse_many</code>, changing
            <code>compile</code> to accept a list of s-expressions instead of
            just one, using <code>defns_and_body</code> to get the definitions
            and body.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can see we also made some other changes here. First, we passed
            the definitions as input to <code>compile_exp</code>. As in the
            interpreter, we&rsquo;ll thread those definitions through all our
            calls to <code>compile_exp</code>, without changing what&rsquo;s in
            the <code>defns</code> list. But we&rsquo;ve also done something a
            bit weird. We&rsquo;ve added additional directives after our
            <code>Ret</code>. What are we putting after <code>Ret</code>?
            We&rsquo;re calling a new helper function
            <code>compile_defn</code> on each of our function definitions, and
            adding the resulting directives to the end of our assembly code.
            Let&rsquo;s take a look at what <code>compile_defn</code> is doing
            to make the function definitions available in our assembly programs.

          <p>
            Our overall goal here is to put each function body at its own label.
          </p>

          <p>
            When we were calling C functions, C was in charge of producing the
            labels for the functions and putting the appropriate assembly
            instructions after. For programmer-defined functions, we&rsquo;re in
            charge of doing the same process. When we&rsquo;re compiling the
            <i>definition</i>, we don&rsquo;t know what values will be passed as
            arguments. In fact, if we call the function multiple times in the
            program, we may be passing in many different arguments. Since we
            can&rsquo;t make the argument values available while we&rsquo;re
            compiling the <i>definition</i>, we&rsquo;ll have to take care of
            making the arguments available when we&rsquo;re compiling the
            <i>call</i>. However, since we&rsquo;re compiling the body right
            now, we still need to know where the body should look to find those
            values. We&rsquo;ll go ahead and decide where the arguments will
            live, even though the call will be in charge of putting the
            appropriate values into those slots.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here we&rsquo;ve decided to put the first argument at the stack
            pointer minus 8, the second argument at the stack pointer minus 16,
            and so on. Remember that the compiler&rsquo;s symtab maps from a
            name to the offset from <code>rsp</code> where it can find the value
            bound to that name. So if a function has n arguments,
            <code>ftab</code> maps the arguments to the first n slots above the
            stack pointer. Once we&rsquo;re ready to compile the function calls,
            that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ll want to put the argument values.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the meantime, we now have enough information to finish compiling
            the definitions. Since we know how much space will be taken by the n
            arguments, we can pass an apprioriate stack index to our
            <code>compile_exp</code> call that compiles the body. We&rsquo;ll
            tell the body not to use any of the slots that are already populated
            with arguments, but anything above that is fair game. And as in our
            compiler, we&rsquo;ve designed <code>ftab</code> so that only the
            function arguments are available within the function body.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, we emit the list of directives. We add a label based on the
            function name. The <code>defn_label</code> function takes care of
            generating an appropriate label&#x2014;this is important because
            some strings are allowable function names in our language but not
            allowable labels in the assembly. After the label, we emit the
            directives for the body itself, and lastly the <code>Ret</code>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now let&rsquo;s move to <code>compile_exp</code> itself and
            compiling function <i>calls</i>.

          <p>
            In some ways, this looks a lot like our C calls. We&rsquo;re still
            doing the <code>Add</code> to point <code>rsp</code> to the last
            used slot (or 8 bytes beyond that, if we need the buffer to keep
            everything 16-byte aligned). We&rsquo;re still doing the
            <code>Call</code> to pass execution to the funtion we&rsquo;re
            calling. And we&rsquo;re still doing the <code>Sub</code> to point
            <code>rsp</code> back to where it pointed before the call.
          </p>

          <p>
            One imporant thing we&rsquo;re <i>not</i> doing: saving
            <code>rdi</code>. Since we control the assembly in the function that
            we&rsquo;re calling, we know none of the code we generate will
            clobber <code>rdi</code>. In fact, if it does update
            <code>rdi</code> because it puts something on the heap, that&rsquo;s
            something we need to know about! So we don&rsquo;t need to save and
            restore <code>rdi</code>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The other big change compared to our C calls: we have to put those
            arguments onto the stack, right where the function definition is
            expecting to find them. Remember, <code>Call</code> increments the
            stack pointer by -8. <code>stack_base + 1*-8</code> thus points to
            the slot where our return address will end up. And
            <code>stack_base + 2*-8</code> points to the slot where we want our
            first argument to live. So we know what offset to use for our
            <code>Mov</code> instruction, for each argument. But what stack
            index should we pass as input when we call <code>compile_exp</code>?
            We can actually use the exact same offset we use for the
            <code>Mov</code>. When we&rsquo;re populating the arguments in the
            stack, we slot them in from the bottom up. If the next available
            slot is at offset <code>x</code>, then we can use any slot at offset
            <code>x</code> or above to calculate the value we&rsquo;ll
            eventually place in <code>x</code>.
          </p>

          <p>
            And with that, we have functions! Open up <code>dune utop</code> and
            try it out!
