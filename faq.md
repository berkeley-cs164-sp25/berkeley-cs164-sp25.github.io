# Frequently Asked Questions

### What size will project groups be?

Projects will all be submitted individually. We've intentionally scaled
the projects to be appropriately sized for individuals working alone!
But don't worry, you can still collaborate---see the collaboration
policy [here](syllabus.html#Collaboration_Policy).

### What language(s) and/or instruction set(s) will we be using?

We'll be writing our compilers and interpreters in OCaml, and our
compilers will be writing x86 assembly code! See the [software
page](./software.html) for more details on software.

### What do I need to do for each assignment? {#submission}

1.  Use the assignment link on the [schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link schedule.md %}) to accept
    the assignment on GitHub Classroom.
2.  Clone the GitHub Classroom generated repo and follow the
    instructions in the README.
3.  Check Ed Discussion for
    clarifications or changes.
4.  Remove any identifying information from your submission ([see full
    policy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link syllabus.md %}#Anonymous_Grading)).
5.  Using the Github option when making your submission to the
    Gradescope assignment,
    select the repo (from step 2) and branch you\'d like to submit
    before **9PM** on the due date. Alternatively, zip your cloned repo
    and submit the zip to the
    Gradescope assignment.
6.  If you would like to withdraw your submission, override it on
    Gradescope with the
    assignment\'s starter code ([see full
    policy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link syllabus.md %}#Withdrawing_Submission)).
7.  Grading will be done on Monday mornings for all submissions.
    Gradescope will automatically check that your submission builds
    **but will not grade your submission**. **All submissions will
    display a grade of zero (or blank) until 10AM on the corresponding
    grading day.**

### How many late days can I use?

Refer to the discussion of [late
assignments]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link syllabus.md %}#Late_Assignments) on the syllabus. For
substantial illnesses or disruptive life events, 
use [the extensions form]({{ site.links.extensions }}) 
([see full policy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link syllabus.md %}#Extensions)).

### How can I submit a regrade request?

Submit regrade requests on
Gradescope **within one
week of receiving your grade** ([see full
policy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link syllabus.md %}#Regrade_Requests)).

### I have a question that is not answered here. How should I get in touch?

Refer to the discussion on [contacting course
staff]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link syllabus.md %}#Contacting_Us) on the syllbaus.
